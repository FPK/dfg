one~\cite{Gerst:18}. Wuhuh. These citations~\cite{Hoelzer:16, Desiro:18} will
not be shown in the  "\ref{sec:bib}~Bibliography" section, because they are
already listed as \verb=\addtocategory{reviewed}{Hoelzer:16}= and

\subsection{Data handling}
Data generated during this project will be used for scientific publications in
preprint and peer-reviewed journals. Therefore, all necessary data (such as raw
sequencing data) will be deposited in publicly available repositories
(\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/}{NCBI GEO} and
\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra}{SRA}, \href{https://osf.io/}{OSF}). To
allow complete reproducibility of all analyses, the source code and executed
comands will be also made publicly available
(\href{https://github.com/}{GitHub}).  Thus, all relevant data will become
accessible for future use. 

\subsection{Other information}
%Please use this section for any additional information you feel is relevant
%which has not been provided elsewhere.
None.

\subsection{Descriptions of proposed investigations involving experiments on humans, human materials or animals as well as dual use research of concern}
Not applicable.

\subsection{Information on scientific and financial involvement of international cooperation partners}
Not applicable.
