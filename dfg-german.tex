\subsection{Stand der Forschung und eigene Vorarbeiten}
% For renewal proposals, please report on your previous work. This report
% should also be understandable without referring to additional literature.

This is a dummy citation~\cite{Hoelzer:17}. Yeah. And another
one~\cite{Gerst:18}. Wuhuh. These citations~\cite{Hoelzer:16, Desiro:18} will
not be shown in the "\ref{sec:bib}~Bibliography" section, because they are
already listed as \verb=\addtocategory{reviewed}{Hoelzer:16}= and
\verb=\addtocategory{nonreviewed}{Desiro:18}= in the praeambl and therefore
shown in subsubsections \emph{Articles published by outlets with scientific
quality \dots} and \emph{Other publications, both peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed}.

\subsection{Umgang mit den im Projekt erzielten Forschungsdaten}
Data generated during this project will be used for scientific publications in
preprint and peer-reviewed journals. Therefore, all necessary data (such as raw
sequencing data) will be deposited in publicly available repositories
(\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/}{NCBI GEO} and
\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra}{SRA}, \href{https://osf.io/}{OSF}). To
allow complete reproducibility of all analyses, the source code and executed
comands will be also made publicly available
(\href{https://github.com/}{GitHub}).  Thus, all relevant data will become
accessible for future use. 
\todo[inline]{FAIR principals}

\subsection{Weitere Angaben}
%Please use this section for any additional information you feel is relevant which has not been provided elsewhere.
In submitting a proposal to the DFG, I agree to adhere to the DFG's rules of good scientific practice and the \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618}{FAIR principles}.
